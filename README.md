# Repository Overview

**Super-Project Description:**

The proposed super project for the ECEN 5783 Embedded Interface Class has been built around the simple notion and philosophy of integration of IoT (connected devices) with the cloud across a huge area (i.e. an Industrial Manufacturing Plant). The prime inspiration behind this project is the fact that the end-user has control over the workplace – where critical data (e.g. number of employees working inside the plant at a specified point in time) can be traced. That said, the second inspiration revolves around the very idea that the user has the freedom to monitor and control the plant activities – probably from anywhere across the globe – as long as the user is connected to the internet or has a cellular network. Moreover, the design and objectives of this project are proposed with the premises that the user or the workplace may not have a consistent supply of internet services (assuming that are intermittent service breakdowns). Given that, it is highly critical of the system ends to meet consistently with the persistent data that rests on the cloud and the same for the data image that exists locally. Synchronization primitives in coherent merger with the buildup of cloud networking will allow the user to monitor/control the workplace.
